To showcase my completed projects, a portfolio site was created using Node.js, Express, and Pug templates. I created a JSON file to store all of the project data. The JSON file was then used to generate the markup in the Pug templates. In the near future, I will update with an actual photo and other personalized info.
EXTRA:
-the package.json was set so that running 'npm start' runs the app
-2 new Pug templates (error & page-not-found) with links back to the home page were created for handling errors
-Changed the background to an image that is light colored and looks textured
-Keyframes were added so the sidebar comes in from the left, and the portfolio-info class comes in from the top
-Added CSS so the 'learn more' and 'back' links change to a blue color on hover
-Added hover effects to the buttons so that the background turns black, and they slightly scale down when hovered
-Added box-shadow and transform on hover to the project images on the index page, and box-shadow to the project images on the project page.
